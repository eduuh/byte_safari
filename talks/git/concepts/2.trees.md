## Under the Hood of a commit
For a commit to be complete we need to store **the information about thefile**

The basic way git store information is using **blob** and **trees** .

Our blob does not store all the information.

1. filenames.
2. directory structure.

#### Question: wheres is this information stored in git?
> #### Trees
A **git tree object** creates a hierachy between files in the git repository and the directory structures.
Every **commit** holds a **single tree** . A tree holds the following informantion.

Tree points  to other.

1. blob
2. Also point to other trees.

Metadata of the **tree**

 * **type** of pointer
 * **filename** of directory name
 * **mode** (excutable file, symbolic link,..)

#### Lets do it step by step
Let's start with a new sample repository again,but this time we doing things manually, so we **get the feeling of what is happening under the hood**.

For the repository we created a while back lets delete the `.git` folder . and initilize a new repository.


```bash
rm -rf .git
# create a file again
echo 'Hello , Edwin' > greeting.txt
git init 
git add greating.txt
```
Lets say it all start when we add the file to the **index / staging area**. When I added the file to , **a change occured in my repository** this can't be view as a commit yet but there is a command to see what happened.
 
```bash
git ls-files --stage
# 100644 9f704ffe0495c8f1416cc004f5638e06e78bf14e 0       greeting.txt
```
We have not commited anything yet but we already have **an object** in our repo. Let get the hash id of 
our content in the **file** we already know how to do that.

```bash
git hash-object greeting.txt
# 9f704ffe0495c8f1416cc004f5638e06e78bf14e
```
You realizes the the **hash key** is the same as that of the content of the **greeting.txt** 

You could also use the **cat-file -t** on the hash to see the type of the object it represent. At this case you will find that its a blob. 

###### the same file will always result with the same blob.

```bash
git cat-file -t 9f704ffe0495c
# blob
```

At this point , The **blob** is not reference by any tree and there are no commits yet. At this point the object is anly referenced from a file named **.git/index** which reference the blob and the tree that makes up the current index.

##### Lets make a tree

```bash
$ git write-tree #
438fa6e39f5e86e72bd959b0c12019f1e39cc70d
```
A **tree** containing the same **blob** or **sub-blobs** will always have the same **hash id**.  We dont have a commit but we have a tree now.

> Lets make a commit manually by using the tree directly

```bash
echo 'Initial commit' | git commit-tree 438fa6e39f5e
# 672df89e038ea79fdac61e8686afe65d07b49dbb
```

the raw commit function takes the tree's hash id and makes a **commit object** to hold it. If i wanted the commit to have a parent i could specify the parent commit with **-p** .

Note my commit **hash id** and your will be different since it uses **my name** and **the current date** as the content to generate the commit object.

#### let see a commit object.
A commit is a code snapshot. A commit points to **tree** and **A parent commit**

and also contains metadata: The content used to generate the **Sha1** files.
> author and committer
> date
> message
> parend commit (one or more)

Identical content is only store once. 

#### Other Optimization - Packfiles and Deltas

1. Git object are compressed .
2. As files change, their content remains mostly similar.
        
        you might add a method here or there.

3. Git optimize for this by compressing  these files together, into a **Packfiles**.
4. The packfile stores the object and `deltas` , of the differences between one version of the file and the next.
5. Packfiles are generated when:
    You have too many objects , during garabage collection, or **during a push to remote.**

Git perform a garbage collection once in a few weeks or when you explicity request it to.

You kind of start to understand what happens during a git push where you see that message. 
   > `compressing deltas`
The `sha1` of the commit is the hash of all this information.

#### Practically

1. lets perfom a git status on the repo we created. Let checkout to the **git2** branch.

```bash
git checkout git2
```

```bash
git status
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    learn-copy.txt
    learn.txt

git add . # add all the files to the staging area
git commit -m "finished working on gitworkshop"
    [master (root-commit) 3cb087a] finished working on git workshop
    2 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
    create mode 100644 learn-copy.txt
    create mode 100644 learn.txt

tree .git/objects
    .git/objects/
    ├── 1e
    │   └── 234f233918794921501400511445247278c890
    ├── 3c
    │   └── b087a3be11296eee71a0527dfe77a139688d68
```

Note after a commit, git provide the first character of the `sha1 hash` identifier for the commit. for this case its **3cb087a** . 

A commit object is also store similary to the blobs.

When you look into the `.git/objects` directory using the tree
command. you notice that the commit create a folder structure and has an object in it.

#### Git-file -T (Type) and -P (PRINT) THE CONTENT

```bash
$  git cat-file -t 3cb087a
    commit

$  git cat-file -p 3cb087a
tree 1e234f233918794921501400511445247278c890
author eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com> 1581803358 +0300
committer eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com> 1581803358 +0300

finished working on git workshop
```

## What we Learn from this : Summary
> We can't change the Commits! You cannot rewrite history.
we can't go back and  change the **author** or any other data.

* If you change any data about the commit, the commit will have a new `SHA1` hash.

* Even if the files don't change the date will and this result to a new `hash`

* This give use the sense of high security in git and you will always know that your commit history will always maintaint its integrity. No one in your team can mess with your commit message without becoming obvious.

* It also secures agaish corruption. If files on the disk change, the repository will notify that the content do not match.

## REFERENCES - POINTERS TO COMMITS **Are stored in `.git/refs` directory

Examples of References.

* tags    => **they dont change : used to version you code.**
* branch  => ***points to the lates commit.**
* HEAD  -> **a point to the current branch**

#### Folder Stucture of the `.git` folder
```bash
        ├── HEAD
        ├── index
        ├── info
        │   └── exclude
        ├── logs
        │   ├── HEAD                        # point to the latest commit
        │   └── refs
        │       ├── heads                   # all the branches lives here
        │       │   ├── git1
        │       │   ├── git2
        │       │   └── master
        │       └── remotes
        │           └── origin
        │               ├── HEAD
        │               └── master
```
##### Note: the branches live in the **.git/refs/heads/master**
let check the master branch and see what it points to. we could use the **cat** command.

```bash
cat .git/refs/heads/master/
3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1

# Confirm this with git log
git log HEAD --oneline
#3811dbf (HEAD -> git2, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master, git1) Section one: part one covered

#head is the pointer to the current branch
cat .git/HEAD
# ref: refs/heads/git2
```


There are instance when head can point to **commits** we are goint to review the cases.

#### Questions:  Why is checkout  git really fast? 
This is because, **there in no pulling in other data.** but its just **changing the pointers.**


#### Review: Places where code lives

1. Working area
2. Staging area
3. Repository

##### Working area
The files in your working area that are also not in the staging area are not handled by git.

Also called **untracked files**

#### The staging area

* What files are going to be part of your next commit.
* the staging area is how git knows what will change between the current commit and the next commit.

##### Tip: a clean staging area isn't empty! consider the baseline staging are as being an exact copy of the latest commit.



#### The Repository
The files git knows about ! Contans all of your commit.

the repository is stored in the `.git` folder.

### Moving files in & of the staging area

command         |  Action           |
----------------|-------------------|
git add <filename> | Add a file to the next commit.
git rm <file> | delete a file in the next commit
git mv <file> | rename a file in the next commit:


#### Git ADD -p
1. One of my favorite tools

allows you to stage commits in hunks Interactively
It's especially useful if you've done too much work for one commit.


### Unstage files fron the staging area

Not removing the files

You're replacing them with a copy that's currently in the repository.

![gitstaging](./../../static/gitstagingarea.png)

### Git STASH

This is usually a way to save uncommited work.

The stash is **safe** from destructive operations.

    changing between branches which requires you to have
    commited all your changes.

![gitsafe](./../../static/gitstash.png)


#### Git stash Basic use

Stash changes

    git stash

list changes

    git stash list

show content

    git stash show stash@{0}

apply the last stash

    git stash apply

apply specific stash

    git stash apply stash@{0}


by default `git stash` stash tracked files that are either in the repository or staging area.
