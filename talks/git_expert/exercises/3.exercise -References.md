## Follow along Exercise- References

### Overview
In this exercise, we'll take a look at our references (`refs`) and create some lightweight and annotated tags. Then we'll make a dangling commit from a "detached HEAD" state and learn why this isn't a great idea.


### Prerequisite
You should have the [`advanced-git-exercises`](https://github.com/eduuh/Advanced-GitWorkshop) repository cloned locally. Checkout the `git3` branch to begin:

```
$> git checkout git3
Switched to branch 'exercise3'
```

```bash
git merge git2
```
## Exercise
1. Check the value of your `HEAD` variable (hint: look in `.git`) and confirm you're pointed at the `exercise3` branch.
2. Use `show-ref` to look at your other heads.
3. Create a lightweight tag and confirm that it's pointing at the right commit.
4. Create an annotated tag, and use `git show` to see more information about it.
5. Get into a "detached HEAD" state by checking out a specific commit, then confirm that your HEAD is pointing at this commit rather than at a branch.
6. Make a new commit, then switch branches to confirm that you're leaving a commit behind.

## Solutions
### Step 1 - Where's your HEAD?
Assuming you checked out the `exercise3` branch in Step 0, your `HEAD` should be pointing to `exercise3`. You can corroborate this with `git branch`:

```
$> cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/exercise3

$> git branch
  exercise2
* exercise3
  master
```

### Step 2 - Where are your refs?
Use `git show-ref` to see which commits your HEADs are pointing at. You should see one for every branch you have, as well as every remote branch we've interacted with. Yours may look slightly different.

```
$> git show-ref --heads
3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/heads/git1
56b0fe1d853f9e09a131a851c93e2c92ba8a6bf2 refs/heads/git2
d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede refs/heads/git3
d9a034a13998d11ed74e678bbe37e29259242beb refs/heads/master
3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c refs/remotes/origin/git2
3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/remotes/origin/master
f94045e34e98329df15b098615268f91c2107eea refs/stash

You can see for yourself that our `master` branch is pointing to our "Initial commit"

```
$> git cat-file -p d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede
tree f21db101b5860d09c98d808ae21aaa96fa512414
parent dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c
author eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com> 1582476695 +0300
committer eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com> 1582476695 +0300

Initial commit
```

Whereas our `git3` branch is pointing to our newer commit from git2:

```
$> git cat-file -p d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede
tree f21db101b5860d09c98d808ae21aaa96fa512414
parent dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c
author eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com> 1582476695 +0300
committer eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com> 1582476695 +0300

Initial commit
```


### Step 3 - Lightweight Tags:
Lightweight tags are simply named pointers to a commit. Make a new tag, then confirm that it points to the correct commit using `show-ref`:

```
$> git tag git2tag

$> git show-ref 
3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/heads/git1
56b0fe1d853f9e09a131a851c93e2c92ba8a6bf2 refs/heads/git2
d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede refs/heads/git3
d9a034a13998d11ed74e678bbe37e29259242beb refs/heads/master
3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
dd160f7cbcaef119f7fb3063df6e9d0607b5e89c refs/remotes/origin/git2
3811dbf83556ffc5d50f9ac3a387b8f29c3d06c1 refs/remotes/origin/master
f94045e34e98329df15b098615268f91c2107eea refs/stash
d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede refs/tags/git2tag

$> git show-ref --tags # to filter only tages
d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede refs/tags/git2tag
```
Our current HEAD, `.d490192..` has now been tagged as `git2tag`. 

You can also do a reverse lookup using `git tag --points-at`:

```
$> git tag --points-at d490192
my-exercise3-tag
```

### Step 4 - Annotated Tags:
Annotated tags serve the same function as regular tags, but they also store additional metadata:

```
$> git tag -a "git2tagannotatedtag" -m "this is my annotated tag for exercise3"

$> git show exercise3-annotated-tag
tag git2tagannotatedtag
Tagger: eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 28 11:27:03 2020 +0300

this is my annotated tag for exercise3

commit d49019211c6a7a4afddd64b1bc5192a042b80ede (HEAD -> git3, tag: git2tagannotatedtag, tag: git2tag)
Author: eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 23 19:51:35 2020 +0300

    Initial commit

diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
new file mode 100644
```

Using `git show`, we can see all of the pertinent information about our `git2tagannotatedtag`We see the tag metadata at the top - who made the tag and when, as well as the tag message. Below that, we see the commit that was tagged, and then the diff between the tagged commit and its parent.

### Step 5 - Detached HEAD
Now we're going to venture into a "detached HEAD" state. Use `git checkout` to checkout the latest commit directly. You'll get a scary-looking warning about your HEAD being detached. You can confirm this by looking at `.git/HEAD` and seeing that it's now pointing to a commit hash, instead of `refs/heads/exercise3`

```
$> git log --oneline
d490192 (HEAD -> git3, tag: git2tagannotatedtag, tag: git2tag) Initial commit
dd160f7 (origin/git2) continue reading the shell scripting book . finished today one hour
96aa314  finished working on Section one part two
3811dbf (origin/master, origin/HEAD, git1) Section one: part one covered
9be8c2f Initial commite348ebc Testing the emergency git-casting system
43388fe Initial commit

$> git checkout d49019 
Note: checking out 'd49019'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at e348ebc... Testing the emergency git-casting system

$> cat .git/HEAD
e348ebc1187cb3b4066b1e9432a614b464bf9d07
```

### Step 6 - Create a Dangling Commit
Even though our `HEAD` is now pointing at a specific commit - instead of a branch or tag - we can still make commits. Go ahead and make a new commit, then confirm that our `HEAD` is now pointing at this new commit:

```
$> echo "This is a test file" > dangle.txt

$> git add dangle.txt

$> git commit -m "This is a dangling commit"
[detached HEAD 510b8d7] this is a dangling commit
 Date: Fri Feb 28 11:39:28 2020 +0300
 1 files changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 dangle.txt
 
$> git log --oneline
510b8d7 (HEAD) this is a dangling commit
d490192 (tag: git2tagannotatedtag, tag: git2tag, git3) Initial commit
dd160f7 (origin/git2) continue reading the shell scripting book . finished today one hour
96aa314  finished working on Section one part two
3811dbf (origin/master, origin/HEAD, git1) Section one: part one covered
9be8c2f Initial commit

$> cat .git/HEAD
510b8d7e663539778d20a93a262e337b8115b080
```

But wait. Because our new commit - `510b8d7` in this case - was made in a detached `HEAD` state, it doesn't have any references pointing to it. It's not part of a branch, and has no tags. This is called a Dangling Commit. You'll see this warning if you try to switch branches:

```
$> git checkout exercise3
D       exercises/2.exercisetwo.md
Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to
any of your branches:

  510b8d7 this is a dangling commit

If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
to do so with:

 git branch <new-branch-name> 510b8d7

Switched to branch 'git2'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/git2' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
```

Here, git is warning you that you're leaving this commit dangling. If you wish, you may create a new branch that points to this commit. Git does a periodic garbage collection and will eventually delete any commits that don't have a reference pointing to them.
