## Exercise Five - History and Diffs

### Overview
In this exercise, we'll practice making a good commit, take a look at some of the interesting command line arguments for `git log`, use `git show` to get more information about a commit, then take a quick look at `git branch`.

### Prerequisite
You should have the [`advanced-git-exercises`](https://github.com/eduuh/Advanced-GitWorkshop)  repository cloned locally. Checkout the `git4` branch:

```
$> git checkout git4
Switched to a new branch 'git4'
```

### Exercise
1. Practice creating a well-crafted commit - look at the format given on the slides for help.
2. Use `git log` to find commits created since yesterday. Rename a file and use the `--name-status` and `--follow` options to `git log` to track down when the file was renamed, and what it used to be called. Use `--grep` to search within commit messages, and `--diff-filter` to find renamed and modified files from `git log`.
3. Use `git show` to get more information about a specific git hash.
4. Try the `--merged` and `--no-merged` options to `git branch` to see which branches have been merged into `master` (or not).

### Solutions

#### Step 1 - Make a Good Commit
We've all made commits with short, "silly", or otherwise unhelpful messages. Let's practice making a solid commit message for use in this example.

```
# Change your `hello.txt` to say [greeting] [noun]! however you want to change it.

$> cat hello.txt
[greeting] [noun]!

# Rename hello.txt to hello.template

$> git mv hello.txt hello.template
$> # if you do a git status you will realize that hello.template is renamed.

$> git add hello.template

$> git commit

# This will open your text editor
# Type the following...
Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n

Currently, hello.txt contains both Spanish and English.
Let's replace Hola with a [greeting] token, and Mundo
with a [noun] token. That way, we can localize hello.txt for
any language!

# Save and exit your editor

[exercise5 4b2b90e] Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

#### Step 2 - Git Log
Let's take a look at our new commit using `git log`. First we'll see how to see all commits in the log since yesterday:

```
$> git log --since="yesterday"
commit 886265f1cd786eec7bf48548f290d162d5307051 (HEAD -> git4)
Author: eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 28 12:32:28 2020 +0300

    Replaced greeting with varibles for i18n
    
    Currently, hello.txt contains both spanish and English.
    Let's replace with a [greeting] token and Mundo with a [noun] token.
    that way, we can localize hello.txt for any language!

commit e7410d10d86edd1bca30f4fa4dbd2e80385518fd (master)
Merge: d9a034a cb0ba30
Author: eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 28 12:00:46 2020 +0300

    Merge branch 'git3'
```

Things can get tricky when trying to track down changes to files when they've been renamed. Here we see how to use `git log` to find the commit where `hello.txt` was renamed to `hello.template`. The `--follow` command will continue following the file backward in history, showing its filename for every commit:

```
$> git log --name-status --follow --oneline hello.template
886265f (HEAD -> git4) Replaced greeting with varibles for i18n
A       hello.template
```

Ever spent too much time trying to track down a commit in Github? Use `git log --grep` to quickly find a commit. We can chain this with other flags. Let's find all the internationalization commits that the author `eduuh` has added in the last two weeks:

```
$> git log --grep=i18n --author=eduuh --since=2.weeks
commit 886265f1cd786eec7bf48548f290d162d5307051 (HEAD -> git4)
Author: eduuh <edwinkamaumuraya0@outlook.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 28 12:32:28 2020 +0300

    Replaced greeting with varibles for i18n
    
    Currently, hello.txt contains both spanish and English.
    Let's replace with a [greeting] token and Mundo with a [noun] token.
    that way, we can localize hello.txt for any language!

```

We can use `--diff-filter` to find commits where files have been renamed:

```
$> git log --diff-filter=R --find-renames
4b2b90e Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n
```

Or to find commits where files have been modified:

```
$> git log --diff-filter=M --oneline
fec9e7b Changing Hello to Hola
afa34a6 Changing World to Mundo
e348ebc Testing the emergency git-casting system
```

#### Step 3 - Git Show
Now that we've mastered `git log`, how do we actually see what happened in a commit? Let's use `git show` to find out.

```
$> git log --grep=i18n --oneline
 886265f1cd7 Replacing greeting with tokens for i18n

# Let's see the full commit and diff for 4b2b90e

$> git show  886265f1cd7

#### Step 4 - Git Branch
Let's say you're working on a complicated codebase with a `master` branch and lots of feature branches. Some of your coworkers forget to clean up their branches when they're done (we're all guilty). Which branches have been merged into `master` and can be cleaned up? Which branches haven't been merged yet? If you've been following along, yours may look different.

```
$> git branch --merged master
  git1
  git2
  git3
  master

$> git branch --no-merged master
 * git4
```
