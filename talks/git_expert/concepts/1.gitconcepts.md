## How is information stored.

At its core, git is like a key value store.

1. **Value** = Data (our files)
2. **Key** => Sha1 Key

> #### Key

Its a **crytographic hash function**. Given a piece of data , it produces a **40 - digit hexadecimal numbers.** You will see this in a bit. 

This **value should always be the same if the given Input it the same**.

> #### Value
Git store  the **compressed** data in a blob , along with the metadata in a header. Holds the **identifier of the**, **size of the content** and the **content** itself.

**Note:** The content is compressed and when you cat into it you will get a whole lot of nothings.

#### Under the Hood - Lets create a git hash object.

Git will take **our content** and use it to generate the `hash` key. For now we could supply some content to git using **echo command**.

If you  run the command. Here we are **piping** the output of the echo command to the git hash function requesting to use the **stdin**

The hash function returns the a **hash** which should be the same for all of us.**your can try this**

```bash 
echo hello | git hash-object --stdin
# ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a
```
We already know some tools that are used to generate **sha1** keys. For my system I believe its **openssl**

lets generate **Sha1** using **openssl**
```bash
 echo hello | openssl sha1
# (stdin)= f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f
```
Thes hash are different. This is because git hash function **prepends thes string "blob" followed by the file size and a null to the file's content before hashing.

This is how git calculates the **sha1** for the file (in git term a blob) 

Git calculate the files metadata + content , not just the content.
```bash
# sha1("blob" + filesize + "\0" + data)  # not \0 is a null byte
```

When you run the hash function on the same content you will always get the same result.

### Lets initialize a repository
```bash
git init
# Initialized empty Git repository in $HOME/username/dir/.git/
```
The initialized repository is store at `.git` directory.

Whey you **delete** this folder in a repository you actually blow up the repository, but you retains the files that were availble in the working area.

> #### question: where are blob stored?

We are going to rerun the command that ask git to generate a `sha1` key for the content but this time we pass a option , **-w** that indicates we want to **write the object to the git repo.**

```bash
echo hello | git hash-object -w --stdin
ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a
```
Take a note at the `hash` generated at this point. and lets access how it is saved in the git folder.

> lets do some clean up first

Remove the `hooks` directory in the repository, so that it does not get into our way.

```bash
rm -rf .git/hooks  # r => recusive f => folders
```

Now you can **tree** into the **.git** folder to pic at all the content. 

Note if you have alot of files in your working directory u are going to have a longer structure. ***The output look something like.
```bash
tree .git/ 
```
```bash
.git/

│   ├── ce
│   │   └── 013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a
```
Our initial `sha1` file was **ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a**.

##### what do you notice?
1. Our blob is stored in the object folder. You can't see that yet but you will.

2 Inside a subfolder which picks the **first two char of the blob** (ce)

3.The blob object as the rest of the char **(013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a)**

### Do this Step by step
1. Create an empty directory and initialize a new repository

Copy the command as it will work.

* `mkdir` makes a directory. 
*  `cd` move into the directory
* `git init` initiaze the repository

```bash
  mkdir test ; cd test ; git init
```
One you initialize a repository **a .git** folder is created where all git information is stored.

The **.git** folder have a few empty directories. If you have never checked the **.git** directory **lets start now**.


2. Check the folder structure of the `.git` directory.
```bash
ls -la .git
```
```
drwxr-xr-x 7 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 ./
drwxr-xr-x 3 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 ../
drwxr-xr-x 2 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 branches/
-rw-r--r-- 1 edd eduuh   92 Feb 15 19:45 config
-rw-r--r-- 1 edd eduuh   73 Feb 15 19:45 description
-rw-r--r-- 1 edd eduuh   23 Feb 15 19:45 HEAD
drwxr-xr-x 2 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 hooks/
drwxr-xr-x 2 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 info/
drwxr-xr-x 4 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 objects/
drwxr-xr-x 4 edd eduuh 4096 Feb 15 19:45 refs/
```
3. Remove the `.git/hooks` folder. you dont need for now
```bash
rm -rf `.git/hooks`
```
4. Look at the folder structure in a graphical way using the tree command. 

```bash
tree .git/
```
3. Lets add a file in our repository. Using the echo command you can **redirect** the output to a file.

```bash
# will write the line ot gitstuff.txt file
echo 'an awesome guide to git' > gitstuff.txt

# you can check the content of the file using cat command
cat gitstuff.txt

git hash-object -w gitstuff.txt
# 24997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f
```
You should the same `hash` code as i get here as long us you use the same content as i did.

This time the **git hash function** command takes a path to a file unlike intially where **echo** was used to input to the **stdin** of the **function**

4. Something i realize with the **ls -la** command that actually the blob is a file. We can just read from it since it compressed into a **c binary** file. Lets try fo fun

lets us the find command to look for all files. Since we now know the blob are store in the **object** we could narrow our search in **directory**.

```bash
find .git/object/ --type f
# .git/objects/24/997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f
```
We've created our first object! this is a binary file that holds what we just saved.

##### Note 
The **object id** is choosen based on the **content** of the object. This is how git stores our object. Let me use the right word here **content-addressable filesystem**.

5. Lets try to save the same file again.

```bash
git hash-object -w gitstuff.txt
```
Because it the same content, nothing changes we will receive the same **sha1 hash key**

6. #### Question: How can we see the content of the blob??

When you cat `pathtofile` you will get a whole lot of **nothing**.To be more accurate **a binary output**

Lets try

```bash
# use the find command to get the path
 find .git/objects -type f
# .git/objects/24/997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f

cat .git/objects/24/997081c3c51eeac9df4309dbcc9452112a8f1f
# xK��OR02aH�SH,O-��MUH/�LIU(�WH�,���
```

Git provides a functions to view the content of blobs.**cat-file**

* -p => print out **pretty print**
* -t => print out the type

For this command you use the **sha1 hash** as the arguement.

```bash
git cat-file -p 24997081
# an awesome guide to git

git cat-file -t 24997081
# blob
```

#### Useful commands

 command           | detail
-------------------| ----------------------
**kkdir** <path> | creates a directory 
**git init**  | initialize git in the directory
**ls -la .git** | lists the content of the **.git** directory
**find .git/object/ -type -f** | list all files available in a directory
**git hash-object -w <path>** | Saves the files to a git object store.
**git cat-file -p <objectid> | pretty print the content of the object in the git object store.
