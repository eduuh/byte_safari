I’m passionate about creating efficient workflows. After several interations,
I've found a layout that really works for me. It not named, should it?. The
results are incredible, and I believe it's worth exploring if you're into
optimizing your keyboard setup.

The biggest disadvantage of a fully custom keyboard layout was that it made my
 computers unusable for **colleagues** and **friends**. But I found a solution
 by mapping the layout at the **keyboard level**. A new world of **programmable
keyboards**.

# Programmable Keyboards

A new problem arose using laptop keyboards became tricky (unless i install
the remapping software i created). However, this is a tradeoff I'm willing
to accept since I **always carry my keyboard** with me. Plus i can now use other
people computers provided the are on qwerty keyboard, using my sweet sweet Nuphy
Air75 keyboard.

I think this is a super big win. I can now type anywhere (I mean this literally): *Linux login
terminals*, *Android TV*, *Sumsung Dex*, and *Windows login terminals*. It 
was incredibly challenging to get my remapping software to work in these
environments. Honestly, creating custom remapping software for my phone and
Android TV felt like a deep rabbit hole, especially compared to just spending
a few dollars on a programmable keyboard.

## Current Layout

_Disclaimer: The ideas shared here are not my original creation. I’ve adopted a layout 
designed by a programmer who was already well ahead in this journey. While I’ve made a few 
tweaks, the core layout remains his work. For more details, [see the original
discussion here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14981498/modified-colemak-for-programming)._

With that said, I'll explain how to set up this layout on a NuPhy keyboard using
the [VIA software remapping tool](https://usevia.app/). A more advanced task is
to compile the QMK firmware directly for the NuPhy keyboard.

**To-Do:** "Compile NuPhy Air75 Keyboard source code with the keyboard as default."


## Colemak Wide Mod

The wide mod introduce greater separtion between the left and right hands by
moving all keys on the right-hand side of the keyboard one space to right.

The benefits of this mod are:

- Helps you achieve a more comfortable posture. Reduces the tendency to be
"hunched over" the keyboard due to the compact nature of most keyboards.
- Easier to reach commonplace keys on the far right-hand side, such as Backspace/Delete and Return/Enter.
- Reduced usage of weak, right pinky finger.
- The Right Alt (or AltGr) key also becomes even easier to use as right-thumb modifier key. If you are not already using this key for accented characters/symbols, you may want to consider bringing it into use for

## Still Colemak?

I’d like to say yes to wide-mode Colemak, but I’ve also remapped some keys and
added more layers. I’ll dive into the details shortly.


## Keyboard Layers

This layout uses 8 layers, which require 3 modifiers:

1. **Shift**
2. **Level3** (often called AltGr)
3. **Level5**

```plaintext
include "level3(lalt_switch)" // Left Alt
include "level5(ralt_switch)" // Right Alt
```

Level5 is less known but very useful, letting you add up to 200 extra characters.

### Understanding the 8 Layers

Here’s how the 8 layers work:

1. No modifiers
2. Shift
3. Level3
4. Level3 + Shift
5. Level5
6. Level5 + Shift
7. Level5 + Level3
8. Level5 + Level3 + Shift

## Numbers

### Inputting Numbers

Numbers are on Layer3. As a rule, I avoid using numbers too often in programming—see [Magic Number (Programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29) for why.

- **1230** are the most common numbers and sit on the home row.
- The right-hand number pad has easy access to `-+.,#%$*/\;:=`, which are key mathematical operators.

I find this layout much more intuitive, reducing the time I spend searching for keys by 10× compared to a standard layout.

## Alternative Characters (With Modifier)

### Level Characters

Less common characters are assigned to Level3 and Level5 with some logic behind it:

- `@` is like `Q`
- `&` is like `B`
- `$` is like `Z`
- `×` is like `X`
- `~` is like `W`
- `` ` `` is on `C` ("aCute")
- `|` is on `V` ("Vertical pipe")
- `%` is on `M` ("Modulus")
- `#` is on `H` ("Hash")
- `<` and `>` are easy to access for HTML
- `^` is next to `<` and `>`
- `+` and `-` are near the numbers, with `-` being the easiest to reach

## Alternative Characters (No Modifier Required)

### Non-Modifiable Keys

These are the most common programming characters:

- `?` and `!` are in the corner since they often end sentences. Colemak is designed to place common sentence-ending letters on index and middle fingers, so putting these on the pinky improves movement.
- `[` and `]` are easily accessible, mirroring `)` and `(`. Regular Expressions use these a lot.
- `)` and `(` are reversed, making it easier to roll your fingers from pinky to index.
- `"` is easy to reach and mirrors `'`.
- `'` is opposite `s`, which is important for the `'s` bigram.
- `{` and `}` are placed in harder-to-reach areas since editors often handle them automatically.
- `*` and `/` are for the `/*` bigram and are common in Vim commands.
- `\` is in the far right corner, resembling `Escape` and working well with `\t`, `\n`, `\r`.
- `;`, `:`, and `=` are similar to `Return`, so they’re placed near the corners.
- `Prior` and `Next` (Page Up and Page Down) are in the middle, ideal for ThinkPad keyboards. They’re great for scrolling through documents and offer flexibility for run configurations.
- `_` (underscore) works well for naming objects and pairs with `m_` and `s_`. It’s placed to avoid the need for shifting.

## Directional Keys

### Moving Up, Down, Left, Right

Inspired by Vim:

- Without the "Wide Angle Mod," reaching for Level5 can be uncomfortable.
- This setup is excellent for editing regular documents.

## Letters

### Alphabet

- Shift + `[A-Z]`
- Capslock and Enter are replaced by Shift.
- Shifts are now Control.
- This change makes Shifts 3× more comfortable and Controls 5× more comfortable.
- I didn’t miss Capslock at all. It’s better as Shift than Backspace or Escape, as long as I have those keys on Level3 or Level5.

## Return

### Using the Return Key

- Return is on `o` because in Vim, it works like Enter.
- It might cause issues in games that don’t detect it, but it’s rare.
- It’s about 1.3× harder to use than the original position, but having Shift on the home row is worth it.

## Functional Keys

### Functional Keys Setup

Accessible via either modifier:

- **Backspace** is on the left pinky, aligning with the direction of deletion.
- **Delete** is on `D`, also aligning with the direction of deletion.
- **Escape** feels best on the Ring Finger rather than the pinky.
- **End** and **Home** are inspired by a Colemak Vim configuration:
  - **Insert** moves to the beginning of the line before editing.
  - **Append** is on `T`, moving in the opposite direction.

Here’s how often I use these keys:

- Backspace: 10× more often than before (now on the Home Row)
- Delete: 20× more often
- Escape: 15× more often
- Home and End: 200× more often, especially when editing documents outside Vim.
