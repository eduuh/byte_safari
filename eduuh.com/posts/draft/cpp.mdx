  - cfront compiler released by AT&T

- 1990
  - Stroustrup published the Annotated C++ reference Manaual (ARM)

- 1993
  - Alexander stepanov of hewlett packard produces a "standard template library"

## Standardization

- 1990
  - other c++ compiler begin to appear
  - C++ standardization process begins

- 1998

  - Main feature:std:string, STL

- 2003
  - Mainly bugfixes to the wording of the 1998 standard
  - A few very minor language changes.
  - last "traditional c++ standard"


## Modern C++

- 2005
 - TR1
 - "Techinical Report" which provided an experimental specification fo some new
   features, mainly in the c++ library.

- 2011
  - Fist "Modern C++" standard
  - Main feature: Smart pointers, lambda expressions, concurrency, move
    semantic, etc etc

- 2013 onwards
   - Variaous "Techincal specifications"
   - "Test bed" for proposed new features

- 2014
   - "Minor release" which completed the 2011 standard.

- 2017
   - Major release
   - Main feature: Structured bindings, string_view, std::filesystem, ranges
   - Some important features dropped due to lack of time

- 2020
  - major release
  - Main features: Concepts, modules, spaceship operator , concurrency
    improvements.


## Local Variables

- Local variables exist inside a scope.
  - A scope is defined by a pair of braces {}

- A local variable comes into existence where it is defined.
  - Memory is automatically allocated for it in the program's stack.
  - it will be initilized.
  - if we do not specify an initial value, it is "default initilized"

- It is destroyed at the end of the scope

```c++
  {           //start of a scope
    int i;    //Allocate memory for i, default initialize it
    ...       //code that uses i
  }           // End of scope - release memory used by i
  // i is no longer "in scope" : have gone out of scope
```
