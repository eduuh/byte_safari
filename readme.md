# Eduuh Byte Safari

- This repository is optimized to be used with my [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/eduuh/nvim), enabling a highly efficient and customizable development workflow.

## Objective

- **Knowledge repository:** Serve as an Obsidian vault for keeping all notes organized in Markdown format.
- **Code and learning hub:** A place for continuous learning, experimentation, and refining skills in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), frameworks, and Neovim configurations.

## 1. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

### Key Goals

- **Unified solution format:** Build each solution in one file with reusable test cases that work across different programming languages.
- **Language diversity:** Solve problems in multiple languages to improve fluency and proficiency in various syntaxes and paradigms.
- **Repository growth:** Continuously add to the repository as new solutions, algorithms, or concepts are learned.
- **Fast debugging:** Use Neovim's DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) for efficient and rapid debugging of solutions.

### Future DSA Enhancements

- **Automated question downloads:** Integrate a system to download problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or any other online judge, and automate the submission of solutions.
- **Competitive programming bootstrap:** Set up an environment for competitive programming with templates and quick-start configurations to speed up problem-solving.
- **Interactive challenges:** Add interactive notebooks or tools like Jupyter to visualize and better understand the algorithms.

## 2. Frameworks Exploration (Any Language)

### Core Principles

- **Sandbox for ideas:** Provide a greenfield environment to test ideas and explore new frameworks without waiting for lengthy build times.
- **Cross-language experiments:** Use the repository to test framework capabilities across different programming languages and environments.

### Future Additions

- **Template generator:** Add a script or tool to generate boilerplate code for common frameworks, making it easy to start new experiments.
- **Framework comparisons:** Create benchmarks or comparison tests to evaluate different frameworks on key factors like performance, ease of use, and scalability.

## 3. Neovim Configuration Testing

### Purpose

- **Stability and reliability:** This section is dedicated to testing and maintaining the stability of my Neovim configuration by experimenting with new plugins, themes, or settings.

### Testing Approach

- **Isolated config environment:** Test new configurations or plugins in an isolated environment to avoid breaking the main setup.
- **Performance checks:** Regularly run tests to ensure the setup remains lightweight and efficient.
- **Version control:** Track changes and test different versions of plugins to ensure compatibility and smooth upgrades.

## 4. Competitive Programming Roadmap

### Immediate Goals

- **DSA Practice Sessions:** Regularly tackle DSA problems to build proficiency in both theory and implementation.
- **Solution Review:** Review and optimize existing solutions to refine coding style and improve efficiency.

### Mid-term Goals

- **Multi-language proficiency:** Solve problems in at least three different languages to enhance problem-solving flexibility.
- **Participation in contests:** Use the setup for active participation in competitive programming platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.).

### Long-term Goals

- **Automated workflow:** Set up a fully automated workflow for downloading problems, solving them locally, and submitting them directly via CLI.

## 5. General Ideas for Growth

- **Versioned solutions:** Keep track of different versions of DSA solutions, comparing performance and approaches.
- **Documentation:** Add comprehensive documentation to make the repository a useful reference for yourself and others.
- **Learning modules:** Organize solutions and notes into modules or categories based on difficulty or topic (e.g., Sorting, Graphs, Dynamic Programming).
- **Code challenges:** Set up daily or weekly code challenges to stay consistent in learning and problem-solving.
