## Eduuh's Byte Safari

This repository is designed to store my public notes, public blog related source code together.

### Objective

- **Knowledge Repository:** Functions as an Obsidian vault, storing notes in Markdown format for easy organization and reference.
- **Learning Hub:** A space for continuous growth, focusing on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), frameworks, and Neovim configuration.

### 1. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

#### Goals

- **Unified Solution Format:** Build each solution in one file, with reusable test cases that work across different programming languages.
- **Language Diversity:** Solve problems in various languages to improve proficiency in different syntax's and paradigms.
- **Repository Growth:** Expand the repository as new concepts and solutions are learned.
- **Fast Debugging:** Leverage [Neovim DAP](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) (Debug Adapter Protocol) for efficient debugging.

#### Future DSA Enhancements

- **Automated Question Downloads:** Integrate tools to download questions from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), or other online judges, and automate solution submissions.
- **Competitive Programming Bootstrap:** Set up a development environment for competitive programming with quick-start templates.
- **Interactive Challenges:** Incorporate tools like embedded code-runners on my
  blog, visualization tools.

### 2. Framework Exploration (Any Language)

#### Core Principles

- **Sandbox for Ideas:** Provide an isolated environment to experiment with ideas and frameworks without waiting for lengthy build times.
- **Cross-Language Testing:** Experiment with various frameworks across different programming languages.

#### Future Additions

- **Template Generator:** Create a script or tool to generate boilerplate code for common frameworks, facilitating rapid experimentation.
- **Framework Comparison:** Set up benchmarks to evaluate different frameworks based on performance, ease of use, and scalability.

### 3. Neovim Configuration Testing

#### Purpose

- **Stability and Reliability:** Dedicated to testing and maintaining the stability of my Neovim configuration by experimenting with plugins, themes, and settings.

#### Testing Approach

- **Isolated Config Environment:** Test new configurations or plugins in an isolated environment to avoid breaking the main setup.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Regularly check the performance of the setup to ensure it remains lightweight and efficient.
- **Version Control:** Use version control to track changes in configuration, ensuring compatibility and easy upgrades.

### 4. Competitive Programming Roadmap

#### Immediate Goals

- **Regular DSA Practice:** Tackle DSA problems regularly to build proficiency in both theory and implementation.
- **Solution Review:** Continuously review and optimize existing solutions for better coding practices and efficiency.

#### Mid-Term Goals

- **Multi-Language Proficiency:** Solve problems in at least three different languages to enhance problem-solving flexibility.
- **Contest Participation:** Actively participate in platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) using the setup.

#### Long-Term Goals

- **Automated Workflow:** Establish an automated workflow for downloading problems, solving them locally, and submitting solutions directly via CLI.

### 5. Ideas for Growth

- **Versioned Solutions:** Maintain different versions of DSA solutions to compare approaches and performance.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Develop thorough documentation to make the repository a useful reference for future use.
- **Modular Learning:** Organize solutions into categories based on topics such as sorting, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Code Challenges:** Set up daily or weekly coding challenges to maintain consistency in learning and problem-solving.
