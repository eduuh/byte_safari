## Action based Editing & Text Objects

- I prefer commands based on actions
  - create (c), start (s), open (o), edit (e)

Here’s a list of actions based on your idea, tailored for editing as a software engineer:

### Action-Based Commands for Editing

### **1. Create (c) <leader>c**

- **Goal**: Generate new files, components, or entities.
  - **Create Note**: Generate a new Markdown file for taking notes (`note.md`).
  - **Create File**: Create a new code file (e.g., `index.js`, `app.py`).
  - **Create Folder**: Create a new directory to organize your files (`mkdir folder_name`).
  - **Create Branch**: Automatically create a new Git branch for the task or feature (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
  - **Create Issue/Task**: Create a new issue or task in an issue tracker like Jira, GitHub, or Asana.
  - **Generate Template**: Create a template file for standard components (e.g., a React component, Node.js middleware).
  - **Create Config File**: Create configuration files like `.gitignore`, `webpack.config.js`.

---

### **2. Start (s)**

- [x]
- **Goal**: Initialize or start processes, services, or apps.
  - **Start Server**: Start a local server for development (`npm start`, `rails s`).
  - **Start Task Tracker**: Begin tracking work using a task management system (e.g., Todoist, Jira).
  - **Start Debugging**: Open a debugger for troubleshooting (e.g., `pdb` for Python, or Chrome DevTools).
  - **Run Task**: Start a pre-defined task like running unit tests, linting, or building assets.
  - **Start CI/CD Pipeline**: Trigger automated build and deployment pipelines (`git push`, `gitlab-ci.yml`).
  - **Start Database**: Start a local database instance or Docker container (e.g., `docker-compose up`).

---

### **3. Open (o)**

- **Goal**: Access files, folders, or projects quickly.
  - **Open File**: Open a file directly (e.g., `index.html`, `app.py`).
  - **Open Recent**: Quickly open recently used files or projects.
  - **Open Terminal**: Open a new terminal window.
  - **Open Git Status**: View the current status of the Git repository (`git status`).

  - **Reorganize Code**: Rearrange code blocks for better readability.
  - **Remove Duplication**: Refactor repeated code into a single function or module.
  - **Apply Design Patterns**: Refactor the code to apply design patterns like Singleton, Factory, or Observer.

---

### **6. Test (t)**

- **Goal**: Run tests to verify code functionality.
  - **Run Unit Tests**: Run unit tests on specific functions or components (`jest`, `pytest`).
  - **Run Test Suite**: Run all the tests in the project to verify the system’s overall functionality.
  - **Run Regression Tests**: Ensure new changes don't break existing features.
  - **Test Coverage**: Check if tests cover all code paths (`jest --coverage`).
  - **Test with Debugger**: Run tests while debugging to trace issues.

These actions are based on common tasks you'll perform while editing as a software engineer. You can assign these to commands or key mappings for efficiency. Let me know if you need help setting up these in Vim or want more ideas!

## Note

This was a good idea in theory. But practically it did not work for me.

## Insert mode

1. <Tab> Open completion
2. <Cr> (enter) confirm completion
3. <C-n> or <Up> select next item
4. <C-p> or <Down> select prev item
5. <C-b> scroll docs down
6. <C-f> scroll docs up
7. <C-q> quit completion.

# Action Based Editing

## Leader

### Create <leader>c

1. Create new notes (n)

   - (1) select obsidian vault in telescope
   - (2) create note based on template

### Open <leader> o

1. Open new note (obsidian) in obsidian vault (n)
2. Open new workspace (obsidian) in obsidian vault (w)
3. Open completion list (c)
4. Open notes tags (t)
   - Add tags <C-l>

### Add <leader> a

## Secondary Leader

1. Create new commit (c) ;c
   - (1) open lazy git
