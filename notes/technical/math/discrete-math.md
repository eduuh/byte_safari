## Sets

A set is a collection of things (objects) that are referred to as elements of the
set.

### Representation

- the ellipses are read out as "and so on"
- component -> name of set, elements of sets (enclosed in curry brackets)

A = { a, & , 1 , what}
B = { a, & , 5 , 12 , ...}

- You could want to refers to "elements of set A"
