## what is the essence of life?

- You network is your net worth

# Money

Business money is not your money UNLESS you want to close that business

## Women

### Dating

Don't date or sleep with a woman who has tattoos.

She has deep-rooted trauma.

She is neurotic, chaotic, and psychopathic.

She will break your TV or stone your car during a disagreement.

You are not a therapist.

We are in the game to win.

### Arguments

No arguments with women,

Don't quarrel.

She is like a child. Ignore her.

Refuse to be drawn into petty chaos and feminine drama,

— Whether it is offline or online

Maintain a stoic demeanour.

WE MUST WIN

### Character

Don't entertain women who talk trash about their previous relationships.

If she talks rubbish & tarnishes her previous relationships, she will also talk bad about you.

She is the problem.

Avoid her.

A good woman avoids her previous failures.

## Men

Avoid reckless ejaculation.

Value your semen.

Transmute your sexual energy to something meaningful.

Also, use a condom.

Once the sperm leaves the urethral meatus, you have little to zero control of the outcome.

Don't live to regret.
