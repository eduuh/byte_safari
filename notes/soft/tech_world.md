## Fun Skill

### Touch Typing

- Touch typing is not about speed; its about need to not look at the keyboard.
  - helps maintain focus on the screen.
  - means: concentration on complex codes, logic and algorithms

#### Advantages

1. Enhanced Efficiency and productivity

   - Write code faster, experiment faster
   - Write notes (not a problem)

2. Improved Accuracy and Reduced Errors

   - reduce likelihood of errors

3. Cognitive benefits and better focus

   - Programming requires deep concentration
   - Touch typing allow you to maintain a train of thought and focus on problems

4. Health and Comfort: Reducing the strain

   - eliminating the need to constantly switch gaze between the keyboard and the
     screen

5. Career advancement and competitive edge

   - proficiency in touch typing means faster, more accurate coding,
     better focus, reduced physical strain, and a competitive edge in the job market

6. Command-Line mastery
   - executing commands faster rapidly and accurately
   - Unlocks keyboard driven workflows

#### TTyper (command line tool)

```bash
cargo install ttyper
```

```ttyper
ttyper -w 1000 -l javascript
ttyper -w 100 -l rust
ttyper -w 1000 -l csharp
ttyper -w 1000 -l english200
ttyper -w 1000 -l english-advanced
```

### Keyboard Centric Workflows

### Scripting

## Day To Day

### Efficiency

1. Context switching. Batching your meetings, remove some meeting.

   - Skip meetings you do not need to attend.

2. Start you day with planning.

   - Assign task in your gaps. Assign task you can finish in this gaps.
     - Learn to break down task
   - Schedule 3 break (10 to 15 minutes)

3. Have boundaries. Say No (if stuff you need to do are throwing you off).

### Leverage

1. Become a consumer of AI/machine learning.
2. Develop customer oriented mindset instead of developer mindset.
3. Mastering communication.
   - Advocating for promotions
   - Communicative leaders
   - Mentoring to master. Mentoring is a tool for mastering

## Technical Skills

### As a back end engineer

You should learn:

- System Design (scalability, micro services)

-APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)

-Database Systems (SQL, NoSQL)

-Distributed Systems (consistency, replication)

-Caching (Redis, Memcached)

-Security (OAuth2, JWT, encryption)

-DevOps (CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes)

-Performance Optimization (profiling, load balancing)

-Cloud Services (AWS, GCP, Azure)

-Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
