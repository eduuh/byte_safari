## Efficiency

1. Context switching. Batching your meetings, remove some meeting.

   - Skip meetings you do not need to attend.

2. Start you day with planning.

   - Assign task in your gaps. Assign task you can finish in this gaps.
     - Learn to break down task
   - Schedule 3 break (10 to 15 minutes)

3. Have boundaries. Say No (if stuff you need to do are throwing you off).

## Leverage

1. Become a consumer of AI/machine learning.
2. Develop customer oriented mindset instead of developer mindset.
3. Mastering communication.
   - Advocating for promotions
   - Communicative leaders
   - Mentoring to master. Mentoring is a tool for mastering

-Distributed Systems (consistency, replication)

-Caching (Redis, Memcached)

-Security (OAuth2, JWT, encryption)

-DevOps (CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes)

-Performance Optimization (profiling, load balancing)

-Cloud Services (AWS, GCP, Azure)
